# PowerCo Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository showcases a predictive modeling project conducted for PowerCo, a major energy utility. The goal was to analyze and predict customer churn, enabling PowerCo to design proactive retention strategies.

## Key Findings
- The predictive model achieved an accuracy of **82%** in identifying customers likely to churn.
- Key drivers of churn: **Net Margin per Consumption**, **Price Difference (Dec-Jan)**, and **Yearly Consumption**.
- Recommendations: Implement a **20% discount strategy** targeted at high-value customers with high churn probability, potentially saving **$10 million annually**.
